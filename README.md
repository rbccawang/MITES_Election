# Math-ocracy: Modeling Elections with Math
Olutobi Adeyeri, Omo Imode, Rebecca Wang

## Problem Statement
You have been commissioned to evaluate two different voting systems: Ranked
Choice Voting (RCV) and Plurality Voting (PV). The goal is to assess how changes to voter population size and number of candidates influences the outcomes of elections under these two election systems. Prior research has shown that voters vote for candidates that are similar to them in terms of political party, location on the policy spectrum, race, and other characteristics. Design a simulation that allows for the election management agency to determine the conditions under which each election system is ideal.
