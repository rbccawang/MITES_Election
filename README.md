# Math-ocracy: Modeling Elections with Math
Olutobi Adeyeri, Omo Imode, Rebecca Wang

## Problem Statement
Do you wonder how different voting systems influence electoral outcomes? Voters vote for candidates that are similar to them in terms of political party, race, and ideologies. We evaluated two popular election systems: Ranked Choice Voting and Plurality Voting. Through mathematically modeling variations to voter population size and number of candidates, we identified ideal conditions for each system to ensure democratic fairness, representation, and efficiency.
