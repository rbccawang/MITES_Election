## Problem Statement
You have been commissioned to evaluate two different voting systems: Ranked
Choice Voting (RCV) and Plurality Voting (PV). The goal is to assess the fair-
ness, representation, and efficiency of each system in electing candidates for one
position in city council. There are 5 candidates running for office: Alice, Bob,
Charlie, Dick, and Emma. There are 500 eligible voters in the district. Each
voter submits a ranked preference ballot indicating their order of preference for
the candidates: Alice (A), Bob (B), Charlie (C), Dick (D), and Emma (E). Each
voter can abstain from voting (O).

### For the Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) system:
* Fairness: Assess the fairness of RCV in terms of proportionality and majori-
tarian bias. Consider the ability of voters to express their preferences through
ranking candidates and the impact of vote transfers in the elimination and re-
distribution rounds.
* Representation: Analyze the extent to which RCV ensures diversity and rep-
resentation. Consider the likelihood of minority candidates being elected, the
ability of different districts to have their preferred candidates elected, and the
influence of voters’ ranked preferences on the final results.
* Efficiency: Analyze how the number of votes “wasted” by abstaining or voting
for an unpopular party impacts the ranking of each candidate and final winner.

### For the Plurality Voting (PV) system:
* Fairness: Assess the fairness of PV in terms of proportionality and majoritar-
ian bias. Consider the potential for a candidate to win with a minority of votes
in the run-off election round(s) and the lack of vote transfers.
* Representation: Analyze the extent to which PV ensures diversity and rep-
resentation. Consider the influence of demographics and the potential for con-
centrated support to dominate the election outcomes.
* Efficiency: Analyze how the number of votes “wasted” by abstaining or voting
for an unpopular party impacts the ranking of each candidate and final winner.
